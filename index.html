    <p> 
      Today I spent most of the day working on non-coding 
      things.  I need to change that now.  My focus is now on coding, 
      finances, the legal aspects of real estate, and going to the 
      gym, in that order.  Although I got some things done, I am 
      disappointed in how the day went, and how much time it is taking 
      me to deal with a tenant who threatened my life.  I resolve to 
      make such behavior his problem and my dealing with it an 
      exercise in strengthening people with good behavior, including 
      myself.  So I promised one of the members who was working with 
      me a website, so I have to work on my coding learning to help 
      him.

    <p> 
      Tonight and tomorrow morning before 5:30 a.m. I will spend 3 
      hours on coding.
